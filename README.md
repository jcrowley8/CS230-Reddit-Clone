Through this project we as students learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. Working with Angular and Bootstrap, the students were tasked with re-creating specific portions of a website of their choosing. During this project, the students worked with various different component styles including menus, buttons, and cards. The students also learned about page routing as well as connecting your front-end code to a back-end database, in this case Firebase. Upon successful completion of all the above items, the students then launched their website clones.

In the first image below, you can see my Reddit website clone which includes information from Firebase above the header.

In the second image below, you can see one of my pages that was used for routing from the home screen.
